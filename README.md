### ðŸ‘‹ Hi There! I am Robin - Nice to have you dropping by! :smiley:

I am currently starting my second year as a Front-End student! 
I have a couple of projects and playgrounds under my first year. 
I am deeply interested in continous developement and transferring information efficiently to the next person. 

This is reflected in my will to teach - in my hobby which is West Coast Swing!
Talk to me any time about Coding / Dancing / Teaching or any other interesting subjects! 

I am proud of my first 4 projects: 
- Gamehub - a cross-course project
- CSM - a bigger site showing a fictual Science Museum
- Westie Addict - My first blog site - which i might turn into a full on blog site. 
- Anime Facts - A simple API based site on fetching some Anime facts. 
  
I feel the design i want to share with the world is visible here - which i am very proud of - and cant wait to develop more! 
I am currently involved in theese languages: 

| Languages i work with ðŸŒ±|
|-------------------:|
| Javascript         |
| CSS                |
| HTML               |
| Python             |
| M                  |
| Typescript         |
| VBA                |
| MS Power Fx        |
| SAS                |
| Excel              |
| DAX                |

- âš¡ Fun fact:
  For me my personal developement started for real when i started dancing. 
  Its my fuel to keep going and invest in myself throughout my life. 
  Currently my ambitions are high and my motivation is even higher! 
  With purpose and momentum we can climb the tallest mountains! Let's keep Climbing!
